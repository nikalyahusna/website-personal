<p><center><font size="5"> Other than that, on the second point which is i am a good listener which means i always got my friends and family's back. 
Whenever they need me, i will be there to listen their problem and help them as much as i could and whenever i need them, they will be there too during
my hard and easy times because i will always remember this one quotes "what you give, you will get back" and that is how life treat you. Always be kind 
to others even they treated you poorly.

<p><center><font size="5"> Last but not least, on my third point which is i am friendly person. I like to make new friends with new people easily. People
who are close to me they will know that i am a shy person but i am not scared of saying "hello" to other people so we can be friends. People may seem i am 
very arrogant or shy but actually i am the nicest person that i can possibly be and i am funny too :D I think that's all for today, i would like to say 
thank you very much to Sir Faizal for reading my website. Stay safe.
